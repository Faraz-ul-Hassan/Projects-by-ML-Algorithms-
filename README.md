# Projects-by-ML-Algorithms-

Welcome to the **Projects by ML Algorithms** repository! This repository contains hands-on implementations of various machine learning algorithms, organized by algorithm type. Each project includes code, datasets (or dataset links), and explanations to help you understand how the algorithm works and how to apply it in practice.

## üîç Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a specific machine learning algorithm and contains:
- A short description of the algorithm
- Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts with step-by-step implementations
- Sample datasets
- Visualizations and performance evaluation


## ‚úÖ Algorithms Covered

- **Supervised Learning**
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Naive Bayes

- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## üìÅ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
